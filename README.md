# oak

oak is a small scripting language designed to be clean, lightweight, and easy to embed in applications like game engines, editors, and configuration files.
Interaction with oak will be done through a C API, possibly with special tools for integrating with C++ code.

## The Current State of Things

At the moment, oak is in a very early stage of development; there is no REPL, there is no debugger, there is very little editor support, and many core
features are missing. So... come back later. Go away. There's nothing to see here.

## Building

You know the drill.
